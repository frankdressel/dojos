# Board

A simple dojo task to create a game board with a simple gui, which should be developed in a very short time (approx. 1h). The board code should be reusable and adaptable to different rules.

## Implementation

No rules are implemented. There should be a callback for real applications. Currently, a board with chess figures is shown on the console and the user can input tuples of start/end coordinates in the following form: e4e6, b7b6, â€¦

## Running

```
go run board_main/main.go
```
